# Hello I am Richard. I am new to programming/coding and eager to learn and do cool stuff. I am starting with python and any help would be greatly appreciated. End goal is to make money from this but that is a ways ahead, for now just in it to learn and for the fun of it. Please treat me well.

# Also a big fan of anime and gaming.
